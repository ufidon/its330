## Lab03: Create threads

### 1. Description
If a task can be divided into several parallel subtasks, then each subtask can be done with a thread, and their results can be aggregated by the process they reside. Computing efficiency can be improved in this way.

In this lab,  create threads on Windows using Windows API and C# to compute the average of large amount of data.
