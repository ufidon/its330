Logical address| physical address | ref bit | page fault
0xE12C         | 0x312C           | 1       | No
0x3A9D         | 0xAA9D           | 1       | No
0xA9D9         | 0x59D9           | 1       | No
0x7001         | 0xF001           | 1       | No

3.2
Any single logical address falls in the unloaded pages 4,8,12,13 will result in a
page fault.
Take page 4 as an example, it has logical addresses: 4*4096 ->
4*4096+(4096-1), i.e. 0x4000 -> 0x4FFF, so any one of 0x4000, 0x4001, . . .,
0x4FFF will result in a page fault. Pay attention: a single logical address
from an unloaded page is referred then this page will be loaded after the
operating system handled this page fault successfully, so successive logical
addresses from this page will not result in page faults unless it is 
replaced by another page.

3.3
Check the page table, frame 6,7,11,12 are not used, as
demonstrated in Question-2, they will be used first. However, in this
question, only the reference bits are used to determine which frames will be
chosen in resolving a page fault. The LRU page-replacement algorithm will
use those frames with reference bit=0 to resolve page faults, check the page table, 
these frames are (9, 1, 14, -, 13, 8, -, 0, 4, -,-, 2), those
dashes are (6,7,11,12), so the set of frames will be chosen in resolving a page
fault are (0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14) in ascending order.
As a toy example, here the total size of physical memory equals the total size
of virtual memory, so all pages can be loaded into frames, once all pages are
loaded, no more page faults will happen. In the real world, the total size of
physical memory usually is less than the total size of virtual memory, so we
need page-replacement algorithms.
Certainly, we can limit the total number frames to be less than the total
number of pages, then page-replacement algorithms can be practiced as
Question-2.
