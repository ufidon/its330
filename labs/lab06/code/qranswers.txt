1.1 The values of the matrix need for processes P0 through P4, respectively, are 
(0, 0, 0, 0)
(0, 7, 5, 0) 
(1, 0, 0, 2) 
(0, 0, 2, 0)
(0, 6, 4, 2)
1.2 The system is in a safe state. With the matrix available equal to (1, 5, 2, 0), either process P0 or P3 could run. Once process P3 completes its execution, it releases its resources, which allows all other existing processes to run.
1.3 The request can be granted immediately. The value of the matrix available is then (1, 1, 0, 0). One ordering of processes that can finish is P0, P2, P3, P1,and P4.
