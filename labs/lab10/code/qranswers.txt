Explanation:
The access flag string -rw-rw-rw- from left to right:
-: file type, regular file
rw-: owner access rights: read, write, no execute
rw-: group access rights: read, write, no execute
rw-: others access rights: read, write, no execute, Pense belongs to others, so he can
read/write this file. These access rights do NOT let others rename/delete key.md5
However, here is an implicit assumption â€” the access rights of the folder containing
key.md5 must be set properly, the minimum access right on the folder is executable
by others.
